# Tackling-Health-Crisis-in-Africa
## A project that laid emphasis on the solutions to tackling health crisis in Africa 
This is a 10alytics Hackathon project where we are required to provide solutions to the health crisis seen in Africa. 
### Data Gathering
For the analysis, we were provided with 6 datasets in which we were are to clean, model and derive insights from them. For the dataset description, check the End drug use in Africa pdf file. 
To find out the death rate by countries, the country's specific population was not provided, so I had to scrape the data using pythn beautiful soup and request library to scrape the data from wikipedia.
