# Tackling-Health-Crisis-in-Africa
## A project that laid emphasis on the solutions to tackling health crisis in Africa 
*This is a 10alytics Hackathon project where we are required to provide solutions to the health crisis seen in Africa.*
### Data Gathering
For the analysis, we were provided with 6 datasets in which we were are to clean, model and derive insights from them. For the dataset description, check the End drug use in Africa pdf file. 
To find out the death rate by countries, the country's specific population was not provided, so I had to scrape the data using pythn beautiful soup and request library to scrape the data from wikipedia. You can check out the .ipynb file to see how I achieved that.
### Data Cleaning 
Check out the power bi file to see how the cleaning was done in power query. I checked for null values, Data structure, Duplicate values, Data types and so on.
### Insights and Recommendation. 
Check out the Tackling Health Crisis in Africa pdf file to see a full dashboard for insight and recommendation.
